## Tic Tac Toe

### About

React Native App bootstrapped with ``expo-cli`` and TypeScript starter. Used feature
branching for my git workflow. I also tagged commits at the end of each hour so feel free to 
either checkout the branches or tags.

### Process / Steps

I began with a basic UI layout and component tree sketched on paper. I then created
the followed branches in sequential order

1. ``setup``: Bootstrapping, removing boilerplate and directory structures.
2. ``components``: Basic component architecture.
3. ``basic-styles``: Get the app to a usable state for interactivity.
4. ``state-setup``: Context API and useReducer state design.
5. ``interactions``: Synthetic events to fire reducer actions.
6. ``game-logic``: Custom hook to check if the player won.
